Step 1: Setting up
Description:
First, we have to come up with the topic for your memory board.
When selecting a theme to work with, we need to remember that our questions and answers shouldn’t be too long.

Flashcards can be used as an educational tool for a wide variety of tasks,
from learning foreign words and scientific terms to memorizing the birthday dates of your new friends.

We chose to make geography themed flashcards that can help you memorize the countries' capitals.
